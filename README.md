# Doppler_HAHEU_MCFR

Scripts, plots, and data relevant to fuel Doppler reactivity feedback coefficient calculation of an MCRE-like reactor.
All done in SCALE/KENO 6.3.1.

* **10-SCALE-ENDF7.1**    - MCRE-like with ENDF-B/VII.1
* **11-SCALE-ENDF8.0**    - MCRE-like with ENDF-B/VIII.0
* **14-HiStatRun-E7**     - MCRE-like high history runs, ENDF-B/VII.I
* **15-HiStatRun-E8**     - MCRE-like high history runs, ENDF-B/VIII.0
* **21-CritSearch**       - Establishing critical dimensions for MCRE-like system when the fuel enrichment varies
* **22-FuelDopplerEnr**   - Fuel Doppler as a function of enrichment, ENDF-B/VII.1
